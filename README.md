# One-dimensional semi-discrete optimal transport toolbox 

Python implemenation of one-dimensional semi-discrete optimal transport problems, and Wasserstein gradient flow discretizations.

Some of the codes are based on the article:

Thomas GallouÃ«t, Andrea Natale, Gabriele Todeschi. [*"From geodesic extrapolation to a variational BDF2 scheme for Wasserstein gradient flows"*](https://hal.science/hal-03790981) (2023).
